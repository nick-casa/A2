What unauthorized sources of information did you use to complete the
assignment? List any unauthorized sources of information that you used
to complete the assignment, and describe how you used them. The course
"Policies" web page defines unauthorized sources of information, and
any source that you have used but not listed in the authorized sources
should be included here. Please note that using an unauthorized source
may trigger a course penalty, and depending on the nature of the
interaction, may additionally require the interaction being reported
to the Committee on Discipline. Write "None" if you used no
unauthorized sources of information.

None

What is your assessment of the assignment? Was it helpful? Was it fun?

This assignment was interesting and insightful. Seeing the two
representations of the same class helped solidify my understanding
of pointers and arrays in C. I also learned from my mistakes and read
the specifications to entirety twice before writing a single line.

(optional) What information can you provide about your submission that
will help your grader to grade it in the most favorable light? In
particular, what bugs are in your submission?



------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does splint generate on stra.c, and what are your
disagreements with them? Copy the splint warnings here, and express your
disagreement after each warning. If there are no warnings, then write
"None."

None

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does critTer generate on stra.c, and what are your
disagreements with them? Copy the critTer warnings here, and express
your disagreement after each warning. If there are no warnings, then
write "None."

stra.c: line 104: low priority:
This area is deeply nested at level 4, consider refactoring

In my Str_search function, there is a level 4 nest (while>if>while>if).
This error is low priority, as the only problem with having such a nest
is readability, and I believe my comments make it as readable as any
other function.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does splint generate on strp.c, and what are your
disagreements with them? Copy the splint warnings here, and express your
disagreement after each warning. If there are no warnings, then write
"None."

None.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does critTer generate on strp.c, and what are your
disagreements with them? Copy the critTer warnings here, and express
your disagreement after each warning. If there are no warnings, then
write "None."

stra.c: line 104: low priority:
This area is deeply nested at level 4, consider refactoring

Like in stra.c, the Str_search function, has a level 4 nest (while>if>
while>if). This error is low priority, as the problem with having
such a nest is readability, and once again, I believe my comments
make it as readable as any other function.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does splint generate on replace.c, and what are your
disagreements with them? Copy the splint warnings here, and express your
disagreement after each warning. If there are no warnings, then write
"None."

None.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does critTer generate on replace.c, and what are your
disagreements with them? Copy the critTer warnings here, and express
your disagreement after each warning. If there are no warnings, then
write "None."

None.

Is it possible for Str_copy or Str_concat to call assert to verify
that the destination memory area specified by the caller is large
enough? Explain.

I thought of a few ways of approaching this problem, but I was not able
to find a way to assert that the destination memory area is enough.
This is largely due to the fact that we do not know where the memory
is stored when its being sent by the client. A client
could allocate a string on the stack or the heap, and as far as I am
aware in this class there is not a function that returns how much
memory is allocated to a pointer.

The first thing that came to mind was trying to find assert memory
using sizeof(), however sizeof(dest) will return 8, the size of the
pointer. To fix this, I thought of the following:
sizeof(char)*Str_getLength(dest)+sizeof(char)*Str_getLength(iSrc),
where the result of this statement would be in an assert and check if
was the size of the destination. The main problem with this is not
being able to return the memory allocated to an object, given its
pointer.
